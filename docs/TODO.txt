Notes to self.
==============

  * Add a *ILanguage* interface, so that we can have classifiers for english,
    greek whatever.
  * Check out clustering techniques. Support vectors looks like the thing to 
    do... This could also provide "related items". Look into LIBSVM, seems 
    robust, fast and supports python.
  * Check out performance of what is already there. POS tagging is slow. Bayes 
    should be ok, it might be even possible to retrain every time an update is 
    done even with lots of docs.
  * Clean up and make things consistent. Probably after decisions about arch. 
    are more stable.
